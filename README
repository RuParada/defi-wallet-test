1. Start a local or web server along with inex.html at the root
2. Install and configure defi wallet and metamask with cronos testnet (chainID is the 338)
3. To protest the metamask for sending a transaction, in the browser console, enter:
    await connectMetamask();
    contract_diamond.buy("0x38fD65cf2594e9aC445c18c516b703c25a4a672f", 1, "Here is your wallet you connected to", gas = undefined, 10); 

4. An error occurs when testing the defi wallet to send a transaction. To test the defi wallet, in the browser console, enter:

    await connectCronos();
    contract_diamond.buy("0x38fD65cf2594e9aC445c18c516b703c25a4a672f", 1, "Here is your wallet you connected to", gas = undefined, 10); 


At the first test, a successful transaction through the defi wallet is possible, but all subsequent ones issue:
